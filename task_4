// 4. Design a Data Architecture for Data Flow and Visualization

// 4a. Design an architecture to support data flow between the
// tracks1 and tracks2 tables in the MySQL RDS database and a visualization
// solution (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, or a custom dashboard). How would this
// architecture change if the number of table sources increased to 20 tables or 2,000
// tables.

// I decided to design this solution around AWS ecosystem.

// Scalability Considerations

// If the number of tables is intended to grow significantly (from 2 to 20 or even 2,000 
// tables), here are some adjustments:
// - Metadata-Driven ETL: Use a metadata-driven approach in AWS Glue to handle data from 
//   multiple tables dynamically, reducing the need for manually updating ETL jobs with 
//   each new table.
// - Data Partitioning and Archiving: Use Amazon S3 as a data lake to archive older, 
//   less-used data while keeping frequently accessed data in Amazon Redshift. Implement 
//   lifecycle rules in S3 to move data to colder storage (like S3 Glacier) after a 
//   certain retention period.
// - Redshift Spectrum: Use Amazon Redshift Spectrum to query data stored in Amazon S3 
//   directly without loading it into Redshift.

// Advantages of this AWS Architecture

// - Scalability: AWS Glue and Redshift provide a scalable, serverless approach to ETL 
//   and data storage, making it easier to handle increasing data volumes and table 
//   counts.
// - Cost-Effective Storage: Amazon S3 offers low-cost storage for raw data and serves 
//   as an efficient data lake, while Redshift provides high-performance querying for 
//   processed data.
// - Real-Time Monitoring: CloudWatch and SNS enable real-time monitoring and alerting, 
//   ensuring quick responses to issues affecting data quality.
// - Serverless Flexibility: Serverless architecture (AWS Glue and QuickSight) reduces 
//   the need for managing infrastructure, allowing us to focus on data and 
//   analytics.

//  Recommendations for Large-Scale Deployments

// - Automate Data Validation: Create validation checks in AWS Glue for better data 
//   accuracy as data volume grows.
// - Optimize Redshift for Performance: Regularly tune Redshift by analyzing query 
//   performance and adjusting partitioning or indexing strategies.
// - Periodic Data Review: Schedule data reviews to assess storage costs, query 
//   performance, and data quality, especially as data grows or new tables are added.

// This architecture leverages AWS to create a robust, scalable, and cost-effective 
// solution that supports both current and future growth in data and analytics needs.
